#Uberfire RAD Extensions
Uberfire RAD extensions or configurable workbench is  group of features divided in four main features: Plugin Management, Perspective Editor, Apps and JS APIs.

##Plugin Management

Uberfire can be extensible by JS and HTML in web app, but this is both powerful and complex.

Plugin Management comes to solve this issue, making our users able to create new perspectives, screens, editors, splash screens and menus via an UI inspired by [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/).

All the UI features are based on JS APIs detailed in previous sections.

###Perspective Editor

Based on Bootstrap grid system, we also created a new dynamic grid builder, were our users will define their own perspectives.
